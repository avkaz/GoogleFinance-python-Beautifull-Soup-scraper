### Description
The Portfolio Tracker Project is a Python-based application designed to help you manage and keep a close eye on your stock portfolio. With this project, you can effortlessly track the value of your investments, monitor the performance of individual positions, and gain valuable insights into your financial holdings.

### Features
Real-Time Stock Data: The project utilizes web scraping techniques to fetch real-time stock price information from Google Finance. This ensures that you always have the most up-to-date data at your fingertips.

* Customizable Portfolio: You can easily customize your portfolio by creating instances of the Stock and Position data classes, specifying the stock ticker, exchange, and the quantity of shares you own.

* Comprehensive Portfolio Summary: The project generates a summary of your portfolio, including essential details such as the ticker symbol, exchange, quantity, stock price, market value, and percentage allocation for each position.

* Currency Conversion: It also handles currency conversion for foreign stocks, providing you with their value in USD for a standardized view of your entire portfolio.

### Important Notes
* As web scraping is used to obtain financial data, changes to the structure of websites can impact the functionality of the project. Be prepared to update the web scraping logic as needed.

* Foreign exchange rates are retrieved from Google Finance for currency conversion. For highly accurate and up-to-date foreign exchange rates, consider using a dedicated financial API service.

* This project serves as a basic portfolio tracker. You can expand and customize it to add more advanced features or integrate it with professional financial data sources.
